                                important areas. Teachers and students both can use the filter panel on the dashboard
                                which enables them to easily navigate the data with their own criteria, giving more
                                control and flexibility. The teacher can create graphical and engaging reports which
                                give them a 360Â° view of the student, which helps the teachers to understand the
                                learning gaps and accordingly improve the student learning outcome</p>
