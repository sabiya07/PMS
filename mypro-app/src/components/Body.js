                    details regarding the number of students attending the test, number of online tests
                    conducted, the number of questions, etc. to guide the administrator to focus on
                    important areas. Teachers and students both can use the filter panel on the dashboard
                    which enables them to easily navigate the data with their own criteria, giving more
                    control and flexibility. The teacher can create graphical and engaging reports which
                    give them a 360Â° view of the student, which helps the teachers to understand the
                    learning gaps and accordingly improve the student learning outcome</p>
